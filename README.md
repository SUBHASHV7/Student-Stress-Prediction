# Student-Stress-Prediction


## Student Stress Level Prediction using Machine Learning
### Overview

This project focuses on predicting student stress levels using machine learning techniques based on daily lifestyle and academic factors. With increasing academic pressure, understanding stress patterns can help in early identification and preventive measures.

### Problem Statement

Student stress is influenced by multiple factors such as study hours, sleep duration, physical activity, and social life. The objective of this project is to analyze these factors and build a predictive model that can classify stress levels effectively.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is student_lifestyle_dataset.csv.
It contains information related to students' daily routines and academic performance.

### Features

1. Study_Hours_Per_Day

2. Sleep_Hours_Per_Day

3. Social_Hours_Per_Day

4. Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Day

5. Extracurricular_Hours_Per_Day

6. GPA

7. Stress_Level (Target Variable)

### Tools and Technologies

1. Python

2. Pandas

3. NumPy

4. Scikit-learn

5. Google Colab

### Project Workflow

1. Data loading and understanding

2. Data cleaning (handling missing values and duplicates)

3. Data preprocessing and encoding

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

5. Train-test split

6. Model training

7. Model evaluation

8. Result interpretation

### Model Used

A supervised machine learning classification model was used to predict student stress levels based on lifestyle factors.

### Results

The model successfully identified patterns between daily activities and stress levels. Factors such as sleep duration, study hours, and physical activity showed a strong relationship with student stress.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to analyze student lifestyle data and predict stress levels. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing and model evaluation in building reliable ML systems.

### Future Improvements

1. Use advanced machine learning algorithms

2. Add more psychological and behavioral features

3. Deploy the model as a web application

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository

2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

3. Ensure the dataset file is in the same directory

4. Run all cells sequentially
